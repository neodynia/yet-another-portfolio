I am always open to constructive advice or reasonable modifications.  Please follow the typical non-master branch -> pull request pathway upheld by the GitHub community.  To review: checkout a new branch and name this branch so it identifies two points of data: the nature of the modification or reason for the pull request and your name.  When ready, please submit the new branch as a pull request and I will approve, approve after modifications, or reject the request.  And as a final note, please be kind and professional - you certainly will know things that I will not know or perhaps never know, and on the flipside I will know different things that you will not know or perhaps never know so lets meet in the middle and show each other so we both leave the experience with at least double the amount of data we had when we entered the exchange.
