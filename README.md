## Overview

This repository contains my current career philosophies, design achievements, and frontend engineering knowledge and serves as a living, evolving representation of my static curriculum vitae that is also available in print or as an electronic document.  Welcome to the showcase of my work which I present with tremedous pride and countless hours of work and struggles.

## Directions

You can view my portfolio by cloning this repo and utilizing your own local environment or server based approach.  A second option is to view this portfolio on [GitHub Pages](https://neodynia.github.io/yet-another-portfolio).  Finally, you may access this portfolio at my custom [domain](http://ryanboris.me).

## Dependencies

1 [jQuery](https://jquery.com)

2 [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

## Contributions

I am always open to constructive advice or reasonable modifications.  Please follow the typical non-master branch -> pull request pathway upheld by the GitHub community.  To review: checkout a new branch and name this branch so it identifies two points of data: the nature of the modification or reason for the pull request and your name.  When ready,please submit the new branch as a pull request and I will approve, approve after modifications, or reject the request.  And as a final note, please be kind and professional - you certainly will know things that I will not know or perhaps never know, and on the flipside I will know different things that you will not know or perhaps never know so lets meet in the middle and show each other so we both leave the experience with at least double the amount of data we had when we entered the exchange.

## Miscellaneous

I swear this is my fourth start over - and why am I not branching these off one master?? Tsk Tsk.  Just for this one type of project it just doesn't feel right to do that - I don't know what's different as my others are structured as branches of the master lineage. LOL.

## Milestones

Starting another portfolio - 6/30/2018
